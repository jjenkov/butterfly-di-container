     * @param parameters The parameters passed to the container when the phase begins. For instance to
     *                   an instance() method call, or an execPhase(phase, factory, parameters) call.
     * @return Null, or the local products the phase ends up being executed on. If executed
     * for several local product arrays (e.g. in pools or flyweights), null will be returned, since it does not
     * make sense to return anything. Returning anything would only make sense for
