 * A Local Factory is a factory that is used inside the container. Local factories are typically chained into

 * called from within a global factory. Local factories are mostly used in global factories when the global
 * factories are created from a Butterfly Container Script. If you plugin custom IGlobalFactory implementations
 * you will typically not need ILocalFactory instances inside it. You would just use plain Java.
